# Classes, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Stacks and Queues

## Classes / Object-Oriented Programming

- Class -> template for an object
  - constructor -> initial values
  - methods -> "functions" on the class

## Stacks and Queues

- Arrays are actually data structures and not data types
- they are secretly special objects behind the scenes
- by adding special rules to an array, we can make it a more specific data structure

## Stacks

- Application
  - Undo and Redo
  - Browser History
  - Function Call Stack

- General Rules
  - LIFO -> Last In, First Out
  - FILO -> First In, Last Out

- Common Methods
  - push() or add() -> add something to the stack
  - isEmpty() -> is the stack empty
  - peek() -> see what is at the top of the stack
  - pop() or remove() -> remove the next item in the stack (last item that was added)
  - count() -> how many items in the stack

## Queues

- Applications
  - Line at a bank
  - Line for a rollercoaster
  - Line for a food truck

- General Rules
  - FIFO -> First In, First Out

- Common Methods
  - enqueue() -> add something to the queue
  - dequeue() -> remove something from the queue
  - peek() or front() -> see what is next in the queue
  - isEmpty() -> see if the queue is empty

## this Keyword

- refers to the object (class) that it is used in
